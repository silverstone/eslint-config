# Silverstone ESLint Config

This is a configuration for ESLint which is meant to focus on warnings rather than errors for things that are purely cosmetic.

## Installation

First, install this package globally to use the installer:

```bash
npm i -g @silverstone/eslint-config
```

Now, you can run the install command (`ss-install-eslint`) in any project directory to automagically set up ESLint:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
ss-install-eslint
```
